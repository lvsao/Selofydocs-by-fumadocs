## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-08

### ✨ New Features

**Dual-Status Tracking System**
- Introduced **Alt Text Coverage** metric: Tracks images with alt text from any source (manual or app-generated)
- Added **Max Optimized** metric: Specifically tracks images optimized by the app
- Enhanced Dashboard Overview with both metrics displayed prominently
- Image Manager now shows dual-layer badges for better visibility

**Enhanced Data Tracking**
- `OptimizeHistory.details` now stores JSON data with `{message, imageIds[]}` for precise tracking
- Improved optimization history with detailed image-level records

### 🎨 UI Improvements

**Dashboard Redesign**
- Simplified Overview cards with large numbers (headingLg) and percentage badges
- Removed redundant progress bars for cleaner interface

**Image Manager Enhancements**
- Dual-status badges: 📝 Has Alt / ❌ Missing + ⚡ Max Optimized
- Clearer visual distinction between alt text status and optimization source

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Manual Edit Logic**
- Fixed: Saving blank alt text no longer incorrectly marks image as "Max Optimized"
- Logic updated: `optimizedByMax: finalAltText.length > 0`

**Settings Defaults**
- Corrected `scheduleFrequency` default value to `"weekly"` (previously inconsistent)
- Automation enable now pre-selects weekly schedule with Monday at 02:00
- Lite plan correctly enforces weekly-only automation
- Max/Ultra plans can choose between daily and weekly schedules

### ⚙️ Technical Improvements

**Multi-Environment Configuration**
- Added `shopify.app.toml` for localhost development
- Added `shopify.app.production.toml` as production reference
- Same App ID with environment-specific instances for better isolation
