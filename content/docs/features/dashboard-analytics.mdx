# Dashboard Analytics

Monitor your store's image optimization status with comprehensive analytics and actionable insights.

## Overview Statistics

### Dual Metric Tracking

**üìù Alt Text Coverage**
- Tracks images with ANY alt text (manual, AI, or template)
- Percentage of total store images
- Helps identify missing alt text across your store

**‚ö° Max Optimized Rate**
- Tracks images optimized specifically by this app
- Shows AI Optimize, Dynamic Format, and Manual Edit results
- Measures app's direct impact on your SEO

<Callout type="info">
**Why two metrics?** Alt Text Coverage shows your overall accessibility. Max Optimized Rate shows how much this app has improved your store.
</Callout>

## By Image Type

View optimization status broken down by content type:

| Content Type | What It Tracks |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Products** | Product images including variants |
| **Collections** | Collection banner and featured images |
| **Blogs** | Article featured images |

Each type shows:
- Total image count
- Alt text coverage percentage
- Max optimized count

## Optimization History

Track all optimization operations performed on your store:

- **Operation Type**: AI Optimize / Dynamic Format / Manual Edit / Automation
- **Image Count**: Number of images processed
- **Status**: Completed / Failed / Partial Success
- **Timestamp**: When the operation occurred
- **Details**: Error messages or specific image IDs affected

<Callout type="warn">
**Best Effort Processing**: If an automation runs low on quota, it will process as many images as possible rather than failing completely.
</Callout>

## Real-Time Updates

Dashboard data refreshes automatically when you:
- Complete a scan (Products/Collections/Blogs)
- Run bulk optimizations
- Edit individual images
- Execute automation tasks

No manual refresh needed‚Äîyour metrics update instantly!
