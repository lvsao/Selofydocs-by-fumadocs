# Bulk Processing

Process hundreds of images simultaneously with intelligent batch operations and global concurrency control.

## Smart Batching

- **Small batches (â‰¤5 images)**: Individual API calls for faster processing
- **Large batches (>5 images)**: Grouped into batches of 10 images
- **Global concurrency pool**: Automatic queue management prevents API rate limits

## How to Bulk Optimize

1. Navigate to **Image Optimization Manager**
2. Select images using checkboxes (or "Select All")
3. Click **Batch AI Optimize** or **Batch Auto Format**
4. Monitor progress in real-time
5. Verify results when complete

<Callout>
**Pro Tip**: You can safely exit the app during processing. Batches continue server-side!

## Performance

| Store Size | Processing Time |
|------------|-----------------|
| 100 images | 2-5 minutes |
| 500 images | 10-25 minutes |
| 1000+ images | 20-50 minutes |
