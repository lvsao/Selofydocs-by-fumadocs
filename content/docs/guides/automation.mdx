# Automation Guide

Automation allows you to set up scheduled scans and optimizations to keep your alt text up-to-date without manual intervention.

## Automation Basics

### What is Automation?

Automation in Max AI Alt Text Optimizer enables:

- **Scheduled Scans**: Regular checks for new or updated images
- **Automatic Optimization**: Apply AI or Dynamic Format to images without manual action
- **Consistent Maintenance**: Keep your alt text optimized as your store grows
- **Offline Processing**: Runs even when you're not logged in

## Setting Up Automation

### Accessing Automation Settings

1. Go to **Settings** > **Automation** tab
2. Toggle the **Enable Automation** switch to ON
3. Configure your automation preferences
4. Click **Save Settings**

### Schedule Frequency

Choose how often your store is scanned:

- **Daily**: Best for stores with frequent updates (Max and Ultra plans)
- **Weekly**: Suitable for most stores (available on all plans)

**Note**: Lite plan is limited to weekly automation for products only.

### Scan Scope

Select which content types to include:

- **Products**: Product images and variants
- **Collections**: Collection banners and featured images
- **Blogs**: Blog post images and thumbnails

**Note**: Lite plan is limited to Products only. Max and Ultra plans can select multiple types.

### Schedule Time

Configure when automation runs:

#### Weekly Schedule
- **Day of Week**: Choose from Monday to Sunday (default: Monday)
- **Time**: 24-hour format HH:MM (default: 02:00)

#### Daily Schedule
- **Time**: 24-hour format HH:MM (default: 02:00)
- Available on Max and Ultra plans only

## Optimization Methods

### Dynamic Format (Auto Format)

Use templates for consistent formatting:

1. Select **auto_format** as optimization method
2. Configure templates in the Templates tab
3. No AI credits consumed
4. Unlimited usage on all plans

### AI Optimization

Use AI to generate contextually relevant alt text:

1. Select **ai_optimize** as optimization method
2. AI credits are consumed based on your plan
3. **Best Effort Mode**: If quota is insufficient, processes as many images as possible
4. Remaining images are skipped without errors

## How Automation Works

### Execution Process

1. **Cron Trigger**: Scheduled task runs at configured time
2. **Distributed Lock**: Acquires lock to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously
3. **Offline Token**: Uses offline access token (no need to be logged in)
4. **Scan**: Scans configured content types for images missing alt text
5. **Filter**: Identifies images that need optimization
6. **Optimize**: Applies selected optimization method (AI or Dynamic Format)
7. **Update Shopify**: Updates image alt text via Shopify API
8. **Record History**: Logs operation with image IDs in OptimizeHistory
9. **Release Lock**: Frees lock for next run

### Distributed Locking

- **Purpose**: Prevents multiple instances from running simultaneously
- **Duration**: 10-minute auto-expiration
- **Cleanup**: Expired locks are cleaned up hourly
- **Instance ID**: `{hostname}-{pid}` identifies lock owner

### Best Effort Quota

When AI quota is limited:

- Processes as many images as quota allows
- Remaining images are skipped
- Operation status: "partial_success"
- No errors thrown
- Next automation run will process remaining images (if quota available)

## Monitoring Automation

### Automation Status

Check automation status in Settings:

- **Enable Automation**: ON/OFF toggle
- **Scan Types**: Selected content types
- **Optimization Method**: AI or Dynamic Format
- **Schedule**: Frequency and time

### Optimization History

Track automation runs in Dashboard:

- **Operation Type**: Shows "automation_ai_optimize" or "automation_auto_format"
- **Image Count**: Number of images processed
- **Status**: completed, failed, or partial_success
- **Details**: Additional information and image IDs
- **Timestamp**: When automation ran

### Re-initialization

After app restart or deployment:

- Automation schedules are cleared from memory
- Call `/api/automation-init` to restore schedules
- Or toggle automation OFF and ON in Settings

## Best Practices

### Optimal Scheduling

- **New Store**: Run weekly for the first month
- **Established Store**: Weekly is usually sufficient
- **High-Volume Store**: Consider daily automation (Max/Ultra plans)
- **Off-Peak Hours**: Schedule during low-traffic times (e.g., 2 AM)

### Resource Optimization

- **Use Dynamic Format** for routine images (saves AI credits)
- **Reserve AI credits** for complex or important images
- **Monitor quota usage** in Plan & Billing page
- **Purchase Pay-As-You-Go credits** for occasional burst needs

### Quota Management

- **Lite Plan**: 10 AI optimizations/month
  - Recommended: Use Dynamic Format for automation
  - Reserve AI credits for manual high-priority images
- **Max Plan**: 400 AI optimizations/month
  - Safe to use AI optimization for automation
  - Monitor usage for large catalogs
- **Ultra Plan**: 1500 AI optimizations/month
  - Ample quota for extensive automation

### Maintenance

- Review automation settings quarterly
- Check history logs for recurring issues
- Update templates as your store evolves
- Adjust scheduling based on catalog update frequency

## Troubleshooting

### Automation Not Running

- Check that **Enable Automation** is ON
- Verify schedule configuration
- Check app logs in recent history
- Try toggling automation OFF and ON

### Images Not Being Optimized

- Verify images are missing alt text
- Check quota availability (for AI optimization)
- Review optimization method selection
- Confirm content types are selected

### Partial Success Status

- **Normal Behavior**: Indicates quota was partially consumed
- Remaining images will be processed in next run (if quota available)
- Consider switching to Dynamic Format or purchasing additional credits
